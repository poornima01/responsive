        Google is an American multinational technology company specializing in Internet-related
        services and products. <br>These include online advertising technologies, search, cloud computing,
        and software.[7] Most of its profits are derived from AdWords,[8][9] an online advertising service
        that places advertising near the list of search results.<br>
        Google was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students at Stanford University.<br>
        Together, they own about 14 percent of its shares and control 56 percent of the stockholder voting power
        through supervoting stock. They incorporated Google as a privately held company on September 4, 1998.<br>
        An initial public offering followed on August 19,<br> 2004. Its mission statement from the outset was
        "to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful,"[10]
        and its unofficial slogan was "Don't be evil".<br>[11][12] In 2004, Google moved to its new headquarters in
        Mountain View, California, nicknamed the Googleplex.[13] In August 2015, Google announced plans to reorganize
        its interests as a holding company called Alphabet Inc. When this restructuring took place on October 2, 2015,
        Google became Alphabet's leading subsidiary,<br> as well as the parent for Google's Internet interests.

        YouTube is a global video-sharing website headquartered in San Bruno, California, United States.

        The service was created by three former PayPal employees in February 2005. In November 2006,<br>
        it was bought by Google for US$1.65 billion.[4] YouTube now operates as one of Google's subsidiaries.[5]
        The site allows users to upload, view, rate, share, and comment on videos, and it makes use of WebM,<br>
        H.264/MPEG-4 AVC, and Adobe Flash Video technology to display a wide variety of user-generated and corporate media video.
        Available content includes video clips, TV clips, music videos, movie trailers, and other content such as video blogging,
        short original videos, and educational videos.
        Most of the content on YouTube has been uploaded by individuals, <br>
        but media corporations including CBS, the BBC, Vevo, Hulu,
        and other organizations offer some of their material via YouTube,<br>
        as part of the YouTube partnership program.[6] Unregistered users can watch videos, <br>
        and registered users are permitted to upload an unlimited number of videos and add comments to videos.
        Videos deemed potentially offensive are available only to registered users affirming themselves to
        be at least 18 years old.

        Gmail is a free, advertising-supported email service provided by Google.[5] Users may access
        Gmail as secure webmail,[6] as well as via POP3 or IMAP4 protocols.[7][8] Gmail started as an
        invitation-only beta release on April 1, 2004[9] and it became available to the general public on
        February 7, 2007, though still in beta status at that time.[10] The service was upgraded from beta status
        on July 7, 2009, along with the rest of the Google Apps suite.[11][12]

        With an initial storage capacity offer of 1 GB per user, Gmail significantly increased the webmail standard
        for free storage from the 2 to 4 MB its competitors such as Hotmail offered at that time.[13] Individual
        Gmail messages, including attachments, may be up to 25 MB.[14] Gmail has a search-oriented interface and a
        "conversation view" similar to an Internet forum. Gmail is noted by web developers for its pioneering use of Ajax.
        [15] Gmail runs on Google GFE/2.0 on Linux.[16][17][18] As of June 2012, it was the most widely used web-based email
        provider with over 425 million active users worldwide.[19][20] According to a 2014 estimate, 60% of mid-sized US companies were
        using Gmail.[21] In May 2014, Gmail became the first app on the Google Play Store to hit one billion
        installations on Android devices.[22]
